# Report based on the analysis:

## Data Overview:
The Boston Housing dataset consists of 506 records. Each record provides various details about a property, such as crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, age, and median home value.

## Descriptive Statistics:
The average median home value across all properties is approximately 22.53 with a standard deviation of about 9.20. The average number of rooms per dwelling is approximately 6.28.

## Data Exploration:
The property with the highest crime rate has a crime rate of 88.98. The property with the lowest median home value has a median value of 5.0.

## Data Distribution Analysis:
About 6.92% of properties are located near the Charles River.

## Correlation Analysis:
There is a strong positive correlation of 0.70 between the average number of rooms and the median home value, suggesting that properties with more rooms tend to have higher values. There is a weak positive correlation of 0.19 between the pupil-teacher ratio and nitrogen oxide concentration.

## Advanced Querying:
The top 5 neighborhoods with the highest median home values were identified. The average property age for neighborhoods near the Charles River is approximately 77.5, compared to approximately 67.9 for those not near the river.

## Visualization:
A scatter plot of property age against median home value was created to visualize the relationship between these two variables.

## Outliers Detection:
Properties with a crime rate greater than 10 were identified as potential outliers. There were 20 such properties.

## Hypothesis Testing:
A hypothesis test was conducted to investigate the impact of the average number of rooms on median home value. The test revealed a significant relationship between these two variables, with a correlation coefficient of 0.70.


## Key Takeaways:

-The average number of rooms per dwelling has a significant impact on the median home value.

-Properties near the Charles River tend to be older than those not near the river.

-High crime rates are associated with lower property values.

-Outliers in the data, such as properties with unusually high crime rates, can provide valuable insights but may also skew the analysis.



This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors that influence property values in Boston. However, it’s important to note that correlation does not imply causation,
and further investigation would be needed to determine the causal relationships between these variables. Additionally, the presence of outliers and the distribution of the data
should be taken into account when interpreting these results. It’s also worth noting that this analysis is based on data up to 2021, and the current situation may be different.
For the most accurate and up-to-date analysis, it would be beneficial to incorporate more recent data.
